# MeeToo

MeeToo is a social media platform that I created as my final project for my coding bootcamp. It features all the basic functionalities of any modern social media platform.

In this repository you can find the frontend side of the project. It is built with React and Vite, and it uses a lightly modified version of Bootstrap 5 paired with basic CSS.

You can find the backend code [here](https://github.com/kaem0n/meetoo-backend).
